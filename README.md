# What is this?

A small programming language I'm making.

I started working on it in April 17, 2021.

Note: it's not done yet, I'm still fixing the bugs and adding more features.

I don't recommed that you try this programming language until I am done with it, it may not behave as intended when working with some incomplete features such as multiline functions or loops etc.

# Prerequisites

- Having [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed.

# How to run

- Open the folder and type `npm install -g` in the terminal.
- Once you're done working on the .uwu file, type `uwu filename` in the terminal to run the file.

# Features

- variables (dynamicly or strictly typed)
- conditional statements (still working on these)
- comments
- loops (for, while, repeat)
- built in get function (fetches JSON from a REST API)
- functions
- modules (no exporting required)
- async/await (coming soon)

# Documentation

I may write the documentation when im done with making the language, but for now here's how to print out text:

```
write "hello"
```
