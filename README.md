# uwu programming language

A small programming language I'm making.

Note: it's not done yet, I'm still fixing the bugs and adding more features.

# Prerequisites

- Having [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed.

# How to run

- Open the folder and type `npm install -g` in the terminal.
- Once you're done working on the .uwu file, type `uwu filename` in the terminal to run the file.

# Features

- print function
- if-else statements
- comments
- variables
- loops (repeat, while)
- built in get function (fetches JSON from a REST API)
- functions
- modules
