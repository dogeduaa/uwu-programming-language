# What is this?

A small programming language that I made for fun.

Note: it's not that usable, it was only made for fun

- Having [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed.

# How to run

- Open the folder and type `npm install -g` in the terminal.
- Once you're done working on the .uwu file, type `uwu filename` in the terminal to run the file.

# Features

- variables
- conditional 
- functions 
- loops 
- modules

# Documentation

I may write the documentation when im done with making the language, but for now here's how to print out text:

```
write "hello"
```
